# calibrating-severity

## Background
Severity of illness scores are used for risk adjustment in the critical care setting, but poor calibration has limited their general acceptance by clinicians. The goal of this work is two-fold: to examine the discrimination and calibration of state-of-the-art approaches in score development, and to see how discrimination and calibration are affected by constraining the homogeneity of case severity.
