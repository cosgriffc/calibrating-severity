# calibrating-severity

## Background
Severity of illness scores are used for risk adjustment in the critical care setting, but poor calibration has limited their general acceptance by clinicians. The goal of this work is to examine if the calibration of models generalized to cohorts defined by case severity will be improved by constraining case-mix in the training sample.
