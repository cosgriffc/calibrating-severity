# Precision Severity Score Development: Constraining Case Mix to Improve Mortality Probabilities
## Christopher V. Cosgriff
<hr />

## Background
Illness severity scores have demonstrated poor generalization performance in forecasting
mortality, particularly for patients at highest risk. One of the drivers of this discrepancy is the
preponderance of patients at low risk of death in training cohorts. We sought to examine the effect of
constraining the training data case mix on the performance of mortality forecasting for high-risk patients.
